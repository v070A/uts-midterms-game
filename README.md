# shan's metamorphosis 🐛🦋

an interactive 3D web experience created for my UTS midterms, exploring physical/sexual self and the journey to self-acceptance through the eyes of a very hungry caterpillar named shan. 

## 🛠️ tech stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- **3D Rendering:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- **Assets:** Custom 3D models made in Blender (mixed with some open-source resources)

## 🚀 how to play
you can play the game live right here in your browser: **[INSERT YOUR GITHUB PAGES LINK HERE]**

## 💻 running it locally
because this project uses ES modules for Three.js, simply double-clicking the `index.html` file won't work due to CORS restrictions. you need to host it on a local web server.

if you are comfortable in the terminal, just navigate to the root folder of this project and run:

\`\`\`bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
\`\`\`

then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
